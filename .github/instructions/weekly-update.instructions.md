## Purpose

The weekly update aims to:

1. Summarize progress across multiple projects in the monorepo
2. Highlight key contributions by team members
3. Provide a clear overview for both technical and non-technical stakeholders
4. Maintain consistent formatting and structure across updates

## Structure

The weekly update should follow this consistent structure:

### 1. Header

```markdown
# Sage Monorepo Weekly Update

[Current Date Range, e.g., July 5-12, 2025]
```

### 2. Highlights (üåü)

A brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) summarizing the main achievements of the week. This should be high-level and accessible to all readers.

### 3. Project Updates (üìä)

Break down updates by project area. For each project:

- Include a brief introduction sentence
- List key updates as bullet points with:
  - Bold headers for each update
  - Brief description of the change/feature
  - Contributors using first names (see [contributors.instructions.md](contributors.instructions.md))

Common project areas include:

- Model-AD Platform
- OpenChallenges Platform
- Agora Platform
- Explorers Framework
- BixArena Project

### 4. Technical Improvements (üõ†Ô∏è)

Group technical improvements by category:

- Infrastructure Enhancements
- Angular Modernization
- Testing Infrastructure
- Other relevant categories based on the week's work

For each category, include bullet points with:

- Bold headers for specific improvements
- Brief description
- Contributors using first names (see [contributors.instructions.md](contributors.instructions.md))

### 5. Contributors (üë•)

List all contributors for the week with their first names and PR counts:

```markdown
This week's progress was made possible by the following contributors:

- Thomas (@tschaffter) - X PRs
- Hallie (@hallieswan) - Y PRs
  ...
```

### 6. Coming Next (üîÆ)

A brief paragraph about upcoming focus areas and expected work for the next week.

## Formatting Guidelines

1. **Use emoji** for section headers to make the document visually engaging
2. **Bold key terms** in bullet points for scannability
3. **Use first names for contributors** - Reference the [contributors.instructions.md](contributors.instructions.md) file to map GitHub usernames to first names
4. **Keep descriptions concise** but informative
5. **Use consistent styling** throughout the document

## Contributor Attribution

Before writing the weekly update, reference the [contributors.instructions.md](contributors.instructions.md) file to:

1. **Map GitHub usernames to first names** for more personal attribution
2. **Use format**: "Enhanced API documentation (Thomas)" instead of "Enhanced API documentation (@tschaffter)"
3. **In contributor lists**: Show "Thomas (@tschaffter) - 5 commits"
4. **Verify contributor information** is current and accurate

## Data Collection Process

### Step 1: Collect Commit Data with Author Information

**CRITICAL: Always verify author attribution before writing**

1. **Primary Method**: Use git log with author formatting:

   ```bash
   git log --since="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" --until="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" --pretty=format:"%h - %an - %s" --no-merges
   ```

2. **Secondary Verification**: Cross-reference with GitHub API data:

   - Use `mcp_github_list_commits` to fetch commits
   - Extract `author.login` field from each commit for GitHub usernames
   - Look for co-authors in commit messages (Co-authored-by lines)

3. **Create Attribution Map**: Before writing any content, create a structured list:
   ```
   Commit Hash - Author Name (@github_username) - Description
   ```

### Step 2: Verify and Count Contributions

1. **Double-check author attribution**:

   - Never assume authorship based on project area or commit patterns
   - Always verify each commit's actual author
   - Pay attention to both git author and GitHub username

2. **Identify all contributor types**:

   - Primary commit authors
   - Co-authors mentioned in commit messages
   - PR reviewers (if mentioned in commit messages)

3. **Count accurately**:
   - Count commits per author, not assumptions
   - Verify final counts against your attribution map

### Step 3: Group and Organize Changes

1. **Group changes by project area and type**:

   - Look for prefixes in commit messages (e.g., "feat(openchallenges)")
   - Group similar technical improvements together
   - Maintain accurate attribution throughout grouping process

2. **Verify technical details**:
   - Read commit messages carefully for technical accuracy
   - Don't embellish or assume technical details not explicitly stated

```

## Common PR Types to Look For

1. **Feature Additions**: Look for "feat" prefixes in commit messages
2. **Bug Fixes**: Look for "fix" prefixes
3. **Infrastructure Updates**: Look for "chore" or "infra" prefixes
4. **Refactoring**: Look for "refactor" prefixes
5. **Documentation**: Look for "docs" prefixes

## Best Practices

### Attribution Accuracy (CRITICAL)

1. **Verify author information explicitly** - Never make assumptions about who did what
2. **Use structured data collection** - Always create an attribution map before writing
3. **Cross-reference multiple sources** - Use both git log and GitHub API for verification
4. **Slow down on attribution** - Getting contributor credit right is essential for team morale

### Content Quality

1. **Verify technical details** against actual commit messages and changes
2. **Acknowledge all contributors**, even for small contributions
3. **Group related changes** together for readability
4. **Highlight cross-cutting improvements** that benefit multiple projects
5. **Use consistent terminology** with the development team
6. **Keep the audience in mind** - make it accessible to both technical and non-technical readers

### Common Attribution Errors to Avoid

1. **Don't assume authorship** based on:

   - Project area expertise
   - Historical contribution patterns
   - Number of commits in timeframe
   - Who merged the PR (often shows as "web-flow")

2. **Always check for**:

   - Co-authored-by lines in commit messages
   - Actual git author vs. committer
   - GitHub username vs. git author name mismatches

3. **Verification checklist before publishing**:
   - [ ] Each contribution is attributed to the correct author
   - [ ] All contributors are acknowledged
   - [ ] PR counts match actual commit data
   - [ ] No assumptions were made about authorship

## Troubleshooting Attribution Issues

### Problem: Git author name doesn't match GitHub username

**Solution**: Use GitHub API to get the correct `author.login` field, or check the GitHub profile for the git email

### Problem: Multiple people worked on a single commit

**Solution**: Look for "Co-authored-by:" lines in commit messages

### Problem: Commits show "web-flow" as committer

**Solution**: This is GitHub's merge commit signature - check the actual author field instead

### Problem: Uncertain about who did specific work

**Solution**:

1. Check the PR discussion on GitHub
2. Look at file history: `git log --follow -- path/to/file`
3. When in doubt, ask the team for clarification

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Get detailed author info for a specific timeframe
git log --since="2025-07-21" --until="2025-07-27" --pretty=format:"%h - %an (%ae) - %s" --no-merges

# Check for co-authors in commit messages
git log --since="2025-07-21" --until="2025-07-27" --grep="Co-authored-by" --pretty=format:"%h - %s%n%b%n---"

# Verify specific commit authorship
git show --format="%an (%ae) - %cn (%ce)" <commit-hash>
```

By following these instructions, you'll create consistent, informative weekly updates that effectively communicate progress across the [Sage monorepo](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/sage-monorepo) project.
